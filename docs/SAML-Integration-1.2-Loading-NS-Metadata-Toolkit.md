# SAML Integration - Loading the NS Metadata Toolkit

What is the NS Metadata Toolkit (the Toolkit)? 

The Toolkit is a Java-based application that runs in your web browser; allowing you to generate the files you'll need to integration with the NSLS. 

Follow these steps to get the Toolkit running on your computer:

1. Ensure the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is installed on your computer: https://java.com/en/download/help/update_runtime_settings.xml

2. Once you confirm the JRE is installed, start the NS Metadata Toolkit by opening a command prompt or terminal window and running the command: 

```java -jar <path to the NS Metadata Toolkit>\NS_Metadata_Toolkit.jar```

4. Next, load the NS Metadata Toolkit by opening a **web browser** and navigating to URL: http://localhost:8080/

6. You should see the following webpage load:
